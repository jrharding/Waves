# Waves

This github repository has two python notebooks to help people with little or no physics knowledge to introduce them to the topics of waves.

They contain text information, visualisations and interactive code to help you learn about the topics which include: what is a wave, terms used to describe waves, what happens when waves travel into a different medium. The second notebook contained: superposition and interference, de Broglie wavelength, energy levels in electrons.

To use these notebooks, we recommend using Jupyter, which can be downloaded for free using the following link - http://jupyter.org/
